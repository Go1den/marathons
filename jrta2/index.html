    <title>JRTA 2 (2015)</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Following up on the unbelievable success that was the first JRTA, JRTA 2 was the quintessential sequel. There were some noticeable differences this time around:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Sluip Show was no more</li>
      <li>The stream backgrounds were a gradient I threw together in GIMP.</li>
      <li>People started slacking on attendance to their runs… and that meant emergency Zooming Secretary shenanigans featuring Puchie D and me.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Despite these faults, JRTA 2 succeeded! We raised $5,508.20 to help bring Becored and Ohon from Japan to participate in Awesome Games Done Quick 2016. There were plenty of positives, too:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Scramble pre-show on IRC</li>
      <li>0xwas wearing maid costumes for his runs</li>
      <li>The closest Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past race of all time</li>
      <li>The fan-favorite race of Super Ghouls ‘N Ghosts with Dice and Malcome</li>
      <li>…and so much more</li>
    </ul>
