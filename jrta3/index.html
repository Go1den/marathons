    <p>What can I say about JRTA 3? The pre-show format was still in limbo. JRTA had The Sluip Show, JRTA 2 had Scramble, and JRTA 3 had Jackbox. We never really did seem to settle on an appropriate pre-show format once The Sluip Show retired. I really enjoyed this JRTA because it featured a rather unusual list of games. Highlights included, but were not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Umihara Kawase block, featuring a four-player race</li>
      <li>0xwas and Nero in their trash-talk filled Mario Party 2 minigame coaster race</li>
      <li>Games like WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, Ultraman Ball, and Sylvan Tale getting the spotlight</li>
      <li>The unforgettable hype that was the SimCity four-player showdown</li>
      <li>Double-digit participation from Japanese runners in the event, highlighting how much JRTA had been truly connecting the Japanese and non-Japanese scenes</li>
      <li>…and much, much more</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When all was said and done, JRTA 3 raised $5,624.82 to help bring Suzuri and zzzhonki to Awesome Games Done Quick 2016. Our total money raised for the three JRTAs up to this point had exceeded $20,000. That’s unfathomable to me to this day. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLibc460joB6iAThiMYFfMUYTaQoi_wedv">You can watch JRTA3 right here.</a></p>

    <p>Suzuri:</p>
